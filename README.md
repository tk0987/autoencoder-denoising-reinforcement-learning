# autoencoder-denoising-reinforcement-learning
simple - just dense


after training loss was as small as 1e-6. training involves my favourite random (i say monte carlo) generation of dataset(s).

in general - window width is set to 128, and combination of peaks,baseline and noise is applied. i didn't assume exponential/other baseline, just the const. but the code can be modified easily
